## Result of CLTV Estimation Study with BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma

Our recommendations to the marketing department for our A Segment customers:

We know that our customers in the A Segment are high-profile, and we want them to be even more engaged and loyal. We suggest to the marketing department to develop personalized communication strategies for this segment. By offering special opportunities such as exclusive offers, birthday discounts, or personal incentives, we can increase customer interest.
We believe it's necessary to launch VIP programs specifically for the A Segment. These programs can make them feel valued by offering exclusive benefits, early access opportunities, and special events. This could help increase customer loyalty.
For this segment, we recommend that the marketing department implement cross-sell and up-sell strategies based on customers' purchase histories and preferences. By recommending products and services they are interested in, we can increase revenue.

Our recommendations to the marketing department for our D Segment customers:

We believe the marketing department should focus on regaining low-profile customers in the D Segment. We suggest they gather feedback to understand why they left, and then offer special offers and campaigns to bring them back.
For this segment, we recommend the marketing department create education and support programs to provide more value. By offering tips, recommendations, or online training related to product usage, we can increase customer satisfaction.
We suggest the marketing department focus on improving the customer experience by targeting D Segment customers. By taking measures such as faster response times and easier return and exchange processes, we can increase satisfaction.

With these recommendations, we expect the marketing department to strengthen customer relationship management strategies by considering the different needs and behaviors of the A and D segments and help increase CLTV.
